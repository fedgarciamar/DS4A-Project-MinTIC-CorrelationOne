This project seeks to enrich the current debate on the variety of factors that influence the behavior dynamics of available Airbnb properties. To do this, an analysis was carried out to understand the relationship between the economic situation of the regions where Airbnbs are located and the number of properties available in a given period; considering variables such as GDP, personal income and the unemployment rate of 12 cities / states of the United States. A multivariate analysis technique is used to estimate a property availability model that adopts ordinary least squares for its adjustment.
